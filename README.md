# AddressBookApplication

This project is an address book application that allows users to store the name, surname, phone number, address, and age of individuals. It also enables users to perform operations such as listing, updating, and deleting registered contacts.

## Technologies Used
- Java Servlets
- JavaServer Faces (JSF)
- HTML and CSS

## Running the Project
1. Clone or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
3. Run the project on a servlet container such as Tomcat.
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080/addressBook` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage
- **Register**: Visit the "Register" page to create a new user account.
- **Login**: Visit the "Login" page to log in with an existing user account.
- **Add Person**: After logging in, use the "Add Person" page to add, update, list, and delete contacts.

## Considerations
- This application is a simple example and should be enhanced with security measures for real-world use.
- User authentication and encryption should be strengthened.
- Consider using a database for data storage.

This project serves as a starting point for learning how to develop basic web applications using Java Servlets and JSF technologies. By continuing to develop and expand its features, you can turn it into a more complex application.
